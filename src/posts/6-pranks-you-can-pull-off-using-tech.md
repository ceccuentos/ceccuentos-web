# 6 Tech Pranks That Will Make You the Office Joker (Harmless Edition)

Want to inject some laughter into your workplace or friend group without causing genuine mayhem? Tech provides a playground for harmless, hilarious pranks. Forget the itching powder; these 6 tech-based pranks are guaranteed to elicit chuckles (and maybe a few bewildered expressions) without crossing the line.

## 1. The Phantom Mouse: A Cursor With a Mind of Its Own

This classic prank is a surefire way to bewilder your target. Imagine their frustration as their mouse cursor dances across the screen independently!

### How to Unleash the Phantom

For Windows users, this prank is surprisingly simple:

1.  Open Notepad.
2.  Paste the following script:

    ```
    MoveMouse()
    WScript.Sleep 5000
    Loop
    ```

3.  Save the file as `ghostmouse.vbs`.
4.  Run the script (ideally minimizing it afterward).

Watch the confusion unfold as they try to regain control of their rogue cursor!

## 2. Blue Screen of... Amusement? The Fake BSOD

Nothing elicits a surge of panic quite like the dreaded Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). This prank leverages that instant reaction for comedic effect.

### Crafting Your Fake Crash

1.  Find a convincing BSOD image or create a full-screen webpage that mimics the Windows error screen. Several free templates are available online.
2.  Set this as their browser's homepage or open it in full-screen mode and pin it to the taskbar.
3.  (Optional) Add a countdown timer for extra realism, suggesting a system restart.

## 3. Autocorrect Anarchy: Subtly Rewriting Reality

The power of autocorrect, weaponized for humor! This prank involves subtly altering their phone or computer's dictionary to replace common words with absurd alternatives.

### Master of Misdirection

1.  **Windows:** Edit the autocorrect settings within Word or Outlook.
2.  **iPhone:** Navigate to Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement.
3.  Get creative! Replace words like "yes" with "affirmative," "no" with "negative," or "the" with "banana." The more unexpected, the better!

## 4. The Printer That Never Quits: A Paper Avalanche

For shared office printers, this prank delivers a slow-burn comedy as a never-ending print job unfolds.

### Unleashing the Paper Monster

1.  Access a shared printer on the network.
2.  Prepare a lengthy, nonsensical document (think lorem ipsum repeated endlessly) or research a command to loop a print job continuously.
3.  Initiate the print job and step back to watch the paper mountain grow!

## 5. Voice Assistant Hijinks: The Talking Head

Smart speakers are ripe for prank potential. Reprogramming Alexa or Google Home to respond to specific phrases with unexpected answers can lead to some hilarious interactions.

### Creative Voice Command Chaos

1.  Program your chosen voice assistant to respond to common phrases in unusual ways.
2.  Examples: Have Alexa say "I'm watching you" when someone says "Hello," or play a spooky sound effect when a specific word is uttered.

## 6. Fake Hacker in Action: Hollywood Hacking at Its Finest

Evoke the mystique of Hollywood hacking with a simple command prompt trick.

### The Imposter's Toolkit

1.  Open Command Prompt (or Terminal on macOS/Linux).
2.  Enter the command `ping -t localhost`. This will create a continuous stream of scrolling text, mimicking a network diagnostic tool.
3.  For added flair, create a batch file (or shell script) with lines of random "hacking" messages and run it in the command prompt.

## The Prankster's Oath

Tech pranks are all about spreading joy and laughter. Remember to choose your target wisely, ensure they have a good sense of humor, and always keep it lighthearted. These 6 tech-powered pranks are designed to inject some fun into the everyday, proving that technology can be just as entertaining as it is useful.
